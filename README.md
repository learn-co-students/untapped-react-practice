# untapped-react-practice
Asks students to create a react app from scratch. Focuses on lifting state and reusing components.

For today's Milestone Lab, we will be creating a Pinterest App for Breweries. the Api we will use to seed our Index is https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries which has several different endpoints if you’d like to get breweries by state or type (check out the documentation here: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

The deliverables for the app are as follows:
- The user should be able to click on a brewery card in the index and choose which show board the card should be moved to. (Hint: maybe use a drop down to select board).
- Once the brewery card is on a board user should be able to delete the card from the board.
- User should be able to create and delete boards. (Hint: “breweries I want to go to” or “breweries I’ve been to”)
- BONUS: User should be able to click on a brewery card that is on a board and the card to should expand to show full details about the brewery.

***YOU SHOULD NOT BE DIRECTLY DELETING FROM THE API.***

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
- Draw out your component hierarchy.
- Think about where state might live.

Here is a mock up of how the app might work:
